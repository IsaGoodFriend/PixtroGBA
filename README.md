# Pixtro GBA
### An open source game engine for the GBA.
This game engine is a modified and updated version of the engine that is used in [GBAleste](https://github.com/IsaGoodFriend/Celeste-For-GBA).  I'm really proud of what I have accomplished with this project.  My goal for this project is to enable people to have an easier time developing games for the GBA.  It's no secret that the GBA is quite a handful for new developers, and I want to make this engine as easy to use as possible while still giving experienced developers the power to create their next masterpiece.


### Features

- Choice of 8x8 or 16x16 sized tiles.
